Methods Overview
-------------------

We proposed `BSCET`, a two-step regression-based procedure that allows us to integrate \underline{B}ulk and \underline{S}ingle-cell RNA-seq data to detect \underline{CE}ll-\underline{T}ype-specific allelic expression imbalance (AEI). In the first step, `BSCET` performs cell-type deconvolution analysis to infer cell type composition in bulk RNA-seq data using scRNA-seq data as the reference. In the second step, given estimated cell type proportions of bulk RNA-seq samples, `BSCET` tests cell-type-specific AEI by aggregating allele-specific bulk RNA-seq read counts across individuals. Since the degree of AEI may vary with disease phenotypes, we further extend `BSCET` to incorporate clinical factors such as disease status to infer covariate effects on cell-type-specific AEI.
